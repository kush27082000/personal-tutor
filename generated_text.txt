The Decline of the Mughal Empire

HE great Mughal Empire, the envy of its contemporaries, for almost two

centuries, declined and disintegrated during the first hair of the 18th century.
The Mughal Emperors lost their power and glory and their empire shrank to a few
square miles around Delhi. In the end, in 1803, Delhi itself was occupied by the
British array and the proud Mughal Emperor was reduced to the status of a mere
pensioner of a foreign power. A study of the process of decline of this great
Empire is most instructive. It reveals some of the defects and weaknesses of
India’s medieval social, economic and political structure which were responsible
for the eventual subjugation of the country by the English East India Company.

The unity and stability of the Empire had been shaken up during the long and
strong reign of Aurangzeb; yet in spile of his many harmful policies, the Mughal
administration was still quite efficient and the Mughal army quite strong at the
time, of his death in 1707. Moreover, the Mughal dynasty still commanded respect
in the country.

On Aurangzeb’s death his three sons fought among themselves for the throne
The 65-year old Bahadur Shah emerged victorious. He was learned, dignified, and
able. He followed a policy of compromise and conciliation, and there was
evidence of the reversal of some of the narrowminded policies and measures
adopted by Aurangzeb. He adopted a more tolerant attitude towards the Hindu
chiefs and rajas. There was no destruction of temples in his reign, In the
beginning, he made an attempt to gain greater control over the Rajput states of
Amber and Marwar (Jodhpur) by replacing Jai Singh by his younger brother Vijai
Singh at Amber and by forcing Ajit Singh of Marwar to submit to Mughal
authority. He also made an attempt to garrison the cities of Amber and Jodhpur.
This attempt was, however, met with firnj resistance. This may have made him
recognisc the folly of his actions for he soon arrived at a settlement with the two
states, though the settlement was not magnanimous. Though their states were
restored to the Rajas Jai Singh and Ajit Singh, their demand for high matisabs and
the offices of sithahdars of important provinces such as Malwa and Gujarat was
not accepted. His policy towards the Maratha sardars (chiefs) was that of half-
hearted conciliation.
